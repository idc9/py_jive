Overview
========

**jive** is a data analysis package for high-dimensional, multi-block
(or multi-view) data. The multi-block data setting means two or more data
matrices with a fixed set of observations (e.g. patients) and multiple
sets of features (e.g. clinical features and gene expression data).


The primary algorithm in this package is Angle based Joint and
Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) which is a data integration/feature
extraction algorithm. AJIVE finds joint modes of variation which are
common to all K data blocks as well as modes of *individual* variation which
are specific to each block. For a detailed discussion of AJIVE see
`Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained`_. An R version of
AJIVE can be found `here`_.

Installation
============
To install use pip:

::

    pip install jive


Or clone the repo:

::

    git clone https://github.com/idc9/py_jive.git
    python setup.py install

jive is currently available for python 3

Example
=======

.. code:: python

    from jive.AJIVE import AJIVE
    from jive.PCA import PCA
    from jive.ajive_fig2 import generate_data_ajive_fig2
    from jive.viz.block_visualization import data_block_heatmaps, jive_full_estimate_heatmaps
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    # %matplotlib inline

    X, Y = generate_data_ajive_fig2()
    data_block_heatmaps([X, Y])

.. image:: doc/figures/data_heatmaps.png

.. code:: python

    # determine initial signal ranks by inspecting scree plots
    plt.figure(figsize=[10, 5])
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    PCA().fit(X).plot_scree()
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    PCA().fit(Y).plot_scree()

.. image:: doc/figures/scree_plots.png

.. code:: python

    ajive = AJIVE(init_signal_ranks={'x': 2, 'y': 3})
    ajive.fit(blocks={'x': X, 'y': Y})

    plt.figure(figsize=[10, 20])
    jive_full_estimate_heatmaps(ajive.get_full_block_estimates(),
                                blocks={'x': X, 'y': Y})
